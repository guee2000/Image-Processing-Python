# Image-Processing-Python
### Image Processing is a process that converting an image into a digital format and carrying out specific procedures to extract some usable information from  it. When implementing specific specified signal processing techniques, the image processing system typically interprets all inmages as 2D signals.

#### Main Feature
**Facial Landmark Detection**
  - Facial Landmark Detection is a computer vision task in which a model needs to predict key points representing regions or landmarks on a human’s face – eyes, nose, lips, and others. Facial landmark detection is a base task which can be used to perform other computer vision tasks, including head pose estimation, identifying gaze direction, detecting facial gestures and swapping faces.

**Normalization**
  - Normalization is a data transformation process that aligns data values to a common scale or distribution of values so that. Normalization includes adjusting the scale of values to a similar metric or adjusting the time scales to be able to compare like periods.

**Gabor-Based Region Covariance Matrix (GRCM)**
  - GRCM is one of the feature extraction method and derived from the fusion of range image and texture image that are presented in the form of concatenation and direct sum approach respectively. The integrity of generated covariance matrix is preserved. It does not go through any transformation. Geodesic distance of Tensor manifold is used as a distance measure between two covariance matrices
